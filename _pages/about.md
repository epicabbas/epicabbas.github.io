Hey, you can call me Abbas. As a masterâ€™s in computer science student, I can add value to your organization through my excellent skills in Android and Web development and version control systems with a drive for excellence. 
I love collaborating with diverse personalities and communities to build great products. 

Beyond coding, I enjoy writing, reading, and teaching tech, and occasionally playing piano and cricket -:)

Let's connect!
